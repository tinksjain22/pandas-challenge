# Pandas Challenge: PyCitySchools
## Overview
This project involves analyzing school and standardized test data to help the cityâ€™s school district make informed decisions about future budgets and priorities. Aggregate and interpret data on student performance to identify trends and make recommendations.

## Background
The dataset includes comprehensive information on math and reading scores across various schools in the district. The goal is to use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to process and analyze this data, providing insights into school performance and areas for improvement.

## Repository Structure
        PyCitySchools: Folder containing the main Jupyter Notebook script used for analysis.
        PyCitySchools.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file where the analysis is performed.
        Resources: Folder for data files related to the project.


## District Summary:

### Calculate and present key metrics in a DataFrame including:
      Total number of unique schools
      Total students
      Total budget
      Average math score
      Average reading score
      % passing math
      % passing reading
      % overall passing
## School Summary:

### Generate a DataFrame summarizing each school's performance with:
      School name
      School type
      Total students
      Total budget
      Per student budget
      Average math score
      Average reading score
      % passing math
      % passing reading
      % overall passing
## Performance Analysis:

### Highest-Performing Schools: 
Identify and save the top 5 schools based on % overall passing.
### Lowest-Performing Schools: 
Identify and save the bottom 5 schools based on % overall passing.
### Scores by Grade:
Create DataFrames for average math and reading scores by grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) for each school.
### Scores by School Spending:
Analyze performance based on school spending ranges. Use spending bins to categorize and calculate averages for math scores, reading scores, and passing percentages.
### Scores by School Size:
Categorize schools by size (small, medium, large) and analyze performance metrics.
### Scores by School Type:
Analyze performance metrics based on school type.
